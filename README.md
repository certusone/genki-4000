# genki-4000

Interim community testnet before GoS resumes tomorrow.

The network will do a quick start, and everyone can join in later by creating a validator on the running the chain. There is NO disadvantage if you join later - after all, testnet tokens are worthless.

- Please register only if you intend to be present at genesis.

- It would be fantastic if we could get this testnet running alongside GoS.
  If you can, run this in addition to your GoS nodes.

- This testnet is coordinated in the #cosmos-validators:matrix.org channel.
